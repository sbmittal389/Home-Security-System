## Home Security System

The aim of the project is to develop a viable home security system using AI applications.

# Approach

The project is developed using:
1. Face Detection using Haarcascade for frontal face detection.
2. Using K-NN Algorithm developed a face recognition system.
3. To translate Speech to Text: Used SpeechRecognition API developed by Google.
   To translate Text to Speech: Used gtts library developed by Google.

# Programming Technologies used:
Languages: Python
Packages: tensorflow, SpeechRecognition, gtts, NumPy, OpenCV, Pandas
